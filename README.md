# pinterestStyled

This site imitates the popular Pinterest website with its search bar menu and page full of images that each lead to a topic in more detail. The site even includes a user page, as well as the ability to favourite and download images. The site is desktop and mobile friendly.

This site is pure HTML and CSS, with the main focus on the use of CSS cards in various styles throughout the pages. The homepage also transforms the cards making them clickable links with a hover overlay effect. All positioning was completed using Flexbox.

It was a lot of fun to replicate the fundamentals of a site and then add my own personal flair. I reall enjoy being given specifications with creative liberties.

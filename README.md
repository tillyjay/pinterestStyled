# Pintrest Styled 

This project imitates the popular Pinterest website, featuring a search bar menu, a page filled with images leading to topics in more detail, a user page, and the ability to favorite and download images. 

## Features 
- Pinterest-Inspired Design: Styled cards with hover effect linking to card with more details.
- Search Bar Menu: Explore topics with a user-friendly search bar menu.
- User Page: Experience a dedicated user page to manage favorites and download
- Favoriting and Downloading: Interact with the site by favoriting and downloading images.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox for positioning)

## Challenges 
- Card styling with overlay and transitions that highlighted different information. Allowed me to improve upon more advanced CSS skills.

## Future Improvements
- Dynamic Content: Introduce dynamic content updates to keep the site fresh and engaging.
- User Interaction: Expand user interaction features, such as commenting on and sharing images.
